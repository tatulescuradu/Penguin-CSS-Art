# Penguin CSS Art

This project is a CSS-based art project where a penguin is drawn using HTML and CSS. The project features a cute penguin character along with some background elements like mountains and a sun. The project was inspired by a challenge from freeCodeCamp.org.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: The HTML file structures the penguin and the background elements, such as the mountains and sun.
- **CSS**: The CSS file is responsible for the visual styling, animation, and positioning of the penguin and the background elements.

## Features

- **Penguin Design**: The penguin is created using various CSS properties, such as `border-radius` for rounded shapes, `position` for precise placement, and `background-color` for coloring.
- **Animations**: The penguin features a waving arm animation that loops infinitely, and the entire penguin scales up when clicked.
- **Background Elements**: The background includes a gradient sky, mountains, and a sun to set the scene for the penguin.

## How It Works

- The penguin's body, head, arms, and other features are all created using `div` elements styled with CSS.
- The waving animation is implemented using the `@keyframes` rule and is applied to the left arm.
- The scaling effect on the penguin when clicked is achieved with the `:active` pseudo-class.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and animations.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the penguin.
